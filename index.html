                <blockquote>
                    "Sudirman is impossible to control and hard-headed, but ultimately intent on doing what was right for the country; although Sudirman often did not like the government's position, he would generally obey his orders."
                    <p>-- Indonesia first Vice President Moh. Hatta</p>
